## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project showcases my skills as a web developer and serves as a platform to share my portfolio, projects, and interests with the world.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: I chose React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, enabling me to build interactive user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: Next.js provides server-side rendering and routing out of the box, allowing for fast and optimized web applications.
- **DaisyUI & Tailwind CSS**: DaisyUI is a component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, providing ready-to-use UI components that align with modern design trends. Tailwind CSS, with its utility-first approach, offers flexibility and speed in styling.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: GSAP empowers me to create stunning animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience and adding visual appeal to my website.
- **GitHub Actions**: Leveraging GitHub Actions for automating the deployment process, ensuring seamless updates to the live website.
